# Character-Level Language Model for Dinosaurus Island

![Dinosaur](images/dino.jpg)

## Introduction

Welcome to Dinosaurus Island, a place where dinosaurs roamed the Earth 65 million years ago, and now they have made a spectacular return! In this assignment, the mission is vital: Tasked with naming the newly created breeds of dinosaurs by a team of leading biology researchers. Choices are crucial because if a dinosaur doesn't fancy its name, it might unleash chaos. Therefore, exercise naming prowess judiciously!

## Project Overview

Equipped with the power of deep learning, the task at hand is to develop a character-level language model capable of generating unique dinosaur names. This algorithm will learn the intricate naming patterns and generate names at random. With this tool in hand, protection from the potential wrath of these resurrected creatures is assured.

## Key Objectives

Upon completing this assignment, the following skills will be acquired:

- Storing text data for processing using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Constructing a character-level text generation model utilizing an RNN
- Generating novel sequences with an RNN
- Understanding the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
- Applying gradient clipping as a solution to the exploding gradient issue

## Getting Started

To commence the journey, load the provided functions in `rnn_utils`. Among these functions are `rnn_forward` and `rnn_backward`, which are analogous to the ones previously implemented. Get ready to embark on the adventure in dinosaur naming!

## Dataset

Your assistant has diligently assembled an extensive list of dinosaur names, which you can access in this [dataset](dinos.txt). Feel free to peruse it through the link.
